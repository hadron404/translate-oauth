# Introduction 前言

> ​	**In** the traditional `client-server` authentication model, the `client` requests an access-restricted resource (protected resource) on the server by authenticating with the server using the `resource owner's` credentials.
>
> In order to provide third-party applications access to restricted resources, the resource owner shares its credentials with the third party. 

​	**在**传统的`客户端-服务器`验证模型里，客户端通过使用`资源所有者`的凭据进行服务器验证，在服务器上请求一个访问受限的资源（受保护资源）。为了让第三方应用访问受限资源，资源所有者与第三方分享它的凭据。

This creates several problems and limitations:

* Third-party applications are required to store the resource owner's credentials for future use, typically a password in clear-text.
* Servers are required to support password authentication, despite the security weaknesses inherent in passwords.
* Third-party applications gain overly broad access to the resource owner's protected resources, leaving resource owners without any ability to restrict duration or access to a limited subset of resources.
* Resource owners often reuse passwords with other unrelated services, despite bets security practices. This password reuse means a vulnerability or exposure in one service may have security implications in completely unrelated services.
* Resource owners cannot revoke access to an individual third party without revoking access to all third parties, and must do so by changing their password.
* Compromise of any third-party application results in compromise of the end-user's password and all of the data protected by that password.

这产生了几个问题和局限性：

* 第三方应用需要存储资源所有者的凭据以便将来使用，（凭据）往往是一个明文密码。
* 尽管密码存在固有的弱安全性，服务器（还是）需要支持密码验证。
* 第三方应用取得十分宽泛的对资源所有者资源访问（权限），资源所有者不具备限制（访问权限）持续时间或者访问一个有限的资源子集的能力
* 资源所有者不管最佳安全实践，经常在不相关的服务上重用密码。密码重用意味
